# MyPerro-Frontend
Hello everyone.
In this code i just used html and css as i didnt have much time to use other tech like nodejs and reactjs as they usually take more time. 
But if you want to check my knowledge in this tech, you can check my other project like homr and cravings whos code is uploaded on github with the same account
i really recommend to check my ohter projects.
Thank you for giving me your time
